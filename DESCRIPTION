Author: Amanda Wang
Maintainer: Amanda Wang <amanda.m.wang21@gmail.com>
Description: This package includes two functions for outputting A/B/n test results.
    The function easy_results() reports pairwise contrasts of all treatment conditions with respect to the reference group (recommendably the control group). 
    The function easy_results_segmented() reports simple effects of treatment within each level of a third, categorical independent variable -- most typically a user segment column.
